"""deploy_guard.py - refuse to publish source, and prove it after the fact.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
On 2026-08-21 these were answering 200 on kineticgain.com:

    /scripts/local-sftp-deploy.sh     /scripts/sign_attestation.py
    /scripts/atomic_ftps_deploy.py    /.github/workflows/deploy.yml
    /generate.py                      /README.md

No credentials were in them. They disclosed the SSH host, the account name,
the non-standard port and the key filename, which is the entire target
description for a credential attack.

Three things had to be true at once, and this file closes all three:

1. THE EXCLUDE LIST WAS A DENYLIST.
   local-sftp-deploy.sh excluded .git, .github, node_modules, README.md,
   CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, docs, staging-root. Someone thought carefully about
   that list. `scripts/` was not on it, and neither was `*.py`. A denylist is
   only ever as good as the last person's imagination; the thing that gets
   published is the thing nobody thought to name.
   -> --preflight uses an ALLOWLIST of extensions that belong on a web server.
      Anything else stops the deploy.

2. DEPLOYS ARE ADDITIVE AND NEVER DELETE.
   deploy.yml says so explicitly, as a feature: "files NOT in the archive are
   NEVER touched", which is what protects the subdomain directories. The cost
   is that one bad upload is permanent. Nothing self-heals. The files above
   were almost certainly published once, long ago, by a path that no longer
   exists, and simply stayed.
   -> --verify probes the LIVE site for paths that must not resolve, so a
      historical mistake is caught on the next deploy instead of never.

3. EVERY EXISTING CHECK ASKED "DOES THE RIGHT THING WORK?"
   The mobile audit, the link scanner, the CI build verification, the live
   curl checks: all of them confirm that pages load, links resolve, gates
   pass. Not one of them could ever have asked whether something that should
   not exist is reachable, because none of them requested a URL that nothing
   links to. A link checker follows links. This is the missing question.

USAGE
=====
    python scripts/deploy_guard.py --preflight <dir>        # before upload
    python scripts/deploy_guard.py --verify https://host    # after upload
    python scripts/deploy_guard.py --verify https://host --json out.json

Both exit non-zero on failure so a shell with `set -e` stops. Both are wired
into scripts/local-sftp-deploy.sh, which is the point: a guard that lives
beside the deploy path is a guard someone forgets. This one cannot be skipped
without editing the deploy script, which is a visible act.

--allow-source exists for the rare case of deliberately publishing a source
file (a demo snippet, a reference implementation). It requires naming each
path, so the exception is explicit and reviewable, never a blanket override.
